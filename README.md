# Defined-by-Shape-Elucidating-the-Molecular-Recognition-of-Dynamic-Loops-with-Covalent-Ligands
Protein loops harness conformational heterogeneity to perform an array of functions, ranging from catalyzing enzymatic reactions to communicating allosteric signals. Although attractive targets for small molecule modulation, these functional hubs are often considered unligandable due to their lack of well-defined binding pockets and...
